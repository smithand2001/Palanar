# Assignment 1
Attempt to recreate: https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/

I'm new to web-development so I watched a few tutorial videos to base some certain features that we didn't cover in class like the drop down menu. Sources used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1DJqPmp4ZU

## BUGS: 
-Couldn't get dropdown menu formatted properly
<br>
-Difficulties aligning two sections together without ruining format eg; Directors message and Headlines
<br>
-Read the directors message alignment bug
<br>
-More events, more facts alignment problems
<br>
-Carousel implementation isn't done yet.
